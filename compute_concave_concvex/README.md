# compute protein surface concave and convex features
## Usage  
```python pdb_pretreat.py 4ZQK_A```
---
_4ZQK_A_: [proteinid] _ [chainid].  
The pdb file of protein should be stored in the _data_preparation/raw_pdbs_.  
The result will be stored in the _oridata/_, named [proteinid] _ [chainid].data.  
Temporary files generated during the calculation are in the directory _tmp/_.
